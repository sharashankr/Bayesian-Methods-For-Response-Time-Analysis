# Bayesian-Methods-For-Response-Time-Analysis
This repository analyzes the opening response time of an electromechanical valve, focusing on seal vintage, fluid type, and coil voltage. It uses Bayesian modeling to identify key predictors influencing valve performance, complemented by exploratory data analysis and visualization to enhance understanding of these dynamics.
